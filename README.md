Extracting temperature data using SQL and visualizing the data to understand the relationship between local temperature and global temperature.

# Observations
	The overall average temperature in Kansas City is ~3-4°C higher than average global temperature.
	In general the overall temperatures increased gradually in both trends, from ~10°C to 13°C in Kansas City and from ~8°C to 9°C in global scale. 
	Both trends experienced a “sharp decrease” and “sharp increase” respectively in early 1800 and 1957. 
	The fluctuation of average temperature in Kansas City is more than the overall global temperature. 
	In early 1770, the temperature in Kansas City is unusually too low! Maybe the data are not recorded well or maybe the City experienced a very cold winter.
